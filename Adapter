#The Adapter pattern allows two incompatible objects to work together by converting the interface of one object into an interface expected by the other object.
#Let's assume an example of a student who becomes an employee after candidate selection process.#We have two model objects Student.java and Employee.java. Student model is for storing the student data. Employee model stores the employee data.
#code
#create Student.java file then execute following code

package Adapter;

public class Student {
	
	    private int id;
	    private String name;
	    private String degree;
	    private double gpa;

	    public Student(int id, String name, String degree, double gpa) {
	        this.id = id;
	        this.name = name;
	        this.degree = degree;
	        this.gpa = gpa;
	    }

	    public int getId() {
	        return id;
	    }

	    public String getName() {
	        return name;
	    }

	    public String getDegree() {
	        return degree;
	    }

	    public double getGpa() {
	        return gpa;
	    }
	}

# Next create Employee.java file then copy and faste code

package Adapter;

public class Employee {
	private int id;
    private String name;
    private String department;
    private double salary;

    public Employee(int id, String name, String department, double salary) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.department = department;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public String getDepartment() {
        return department;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }
}

#then create   CandidateSelectionProcess.java file then copy paste following code

package Adapter;

public class CandidateSelectionProcess {
	public Employee selectCandidate(Student student) {
        // Simulate the selection process
        if (student.getGpa() >= 3.5) {
            // Create an Employee object from the Student object
            Employee employee = new Employee(student.getId(), student.getName(), "IT", 50000.0);
            return employee;
        } else {
            return null; // Student is not selected
        }
	}
}

#then create  main.java file then copy paste following code

package Adapter;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Student student = new Student(1, "John Doe", "Computer Science", 3.7);
        CandidateSelectionProcess process = new CandidateSelectionProcess();
        Employee employee = process.selectCandidate(student);
        if (employee != null) {
            System.out.println("Student is selected as an employee:");
            System.out.println("ID: " + employee.getId());
            System.out.println("Name: " + employee.getName());
            System.out.println("Department: " + employee.getDepartment());
            System.out.println("Salary: " + employee.getSalary());
        } else {
